This package uses quilt to manage all modifications to the upstream source.
Changes are stored in the source package as diffs in patches/ and applied
during the build.

The patches are applied using the patches/patchinstall.sh script.  This is
done at the configure part during the package build (see
override_dh_auto_configure in debian/rules).
