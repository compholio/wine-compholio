 Microsoft Windows Compatibility Layer (Binary Emulator and Library)
 Wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows applications on Linux.
 Applications are run at full speed without the need of cpu emulation. Wine
 does not require Microsoft Windows, however it can use native system dll
 files in place of its own if they are available.
 .
 This package provides support for loading 32-bit x86 Windows applications
 .
 This package is based on a recent Wine beta.  While many more applications
 will work, there may be some loss of functionality compared with the stable
 release provided by the regular wine package.
